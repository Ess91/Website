                    Continued...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Initially our idea was to do a movie streaming web application, so my first task was to research
                    which movie streaming services had public APIs. As I started researching, I realised there werenâ€™t
                    many movie streaming services that had public APIs that retrieved the data that I wanted, I looked
                    at Netflix, Disney...pretty much every streaming service. There were a lot of unofficial APIs but it
                    was not allowing me to retrieve the data that I wanted. So by week 3/4, we had to change directions
                    and look at the music streaming services. I was able to find public APIs for Spotify, Deezer,
                    Napster and YouTube which was better but due to the time that was left I made the decision to reduce
                    how many streaming services that we used. Although, I had tried all the streaming services I had to
                    reduce it, to just two, Spotify and Deezer. I worked on Spotify and was able to retrieve what I
                    needed, Deezer on the other hand was a challenge and was able to only do the first part of the user
                    authentication but redirecting the user to the profile page was another challenge. This was when I
                    asked for help but as a team we hit a brick wall.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We worked during the coming weeks, we discussed what we were working on, we asked for help when
                    needed and I believe we worked really well as a team. This was the first time in discussing with
                    other people about coding and I was really excited by this lol. The last week was crucial, the
                    deadline was the 14th March a The issue we had with Deezer, with all the google searches and YouTube
                    videos and threads we eventually had to scrap due to not having enough time (if I had more time, I
                    would definitely work on it some more) and so we just used the Spotify APIs. I was able to do user
                    authentication using the help of Spotify Web Docs, and was able to fetch the top 5 tracks data, the
                    song name, the album from which the song was from, the artists and the image as well as the userâ€™s
                    profile image. Once we completed the front-end and back-end development side, we merged the branches
                    together..How Cool lol! Iâ€™ve never done it before but I learnt through my other team-mate. This is
                    what we achieved, a very simple web application:
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="img/blog/Screenshot 2021-03-17 18.31.49.png" width="800"
                    style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><br>
                <img src="img/blog/screenshot-45.79.148.207_8888-2021.03.17-18_32_09.png" width="800"
                    style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
                <br>
                <p>(Please donâ€™t ask me about the first track lol! My son listens to it 24/7 ðŸ™„)</p>

                <p>
                    Next, I had to change the redirect uri, this is when a user successfully authorizes an application,
                    the authorization server will redirect the user back to the application. When I was building the
                    backend of things I was using a localhost server which was my local machine/computer the program was
                    running on. As itâ€™s on a localhost, it wouldnâ€™t work for other users to use the application and so I
                    had to change this and in order for this to happen we had to host the application. We suggested a
                    few free hosting sites, Linode, Netlify and Vercel. Originally, we wanted to use Netflify as it was
                    free and from past experiences Iâ€™ve had no problems with it. However, after a lot of debugging and
                    google searches we realised NodeJS may not be straightforward with Netflify, so we opted for Linode
                    which is a cloud server and worked really well with ease. Once it was deployed, we changed the
                    redirect uri and the project was officially completed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chingu was really good for me because I got to work on a project with a team. We worked in an agile
                    environment which a lot of companies are asking for potential candidates to have experience in.
                    Although it was a nerve-wracking feeling from the start, I really worked with an incredible team
                    from different countries and was able to adjust with different time zones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This overall experience was amazing, it pushed me to work above what I defined myself as a
                    developer. Originally, I wanted to just work as a front-end developer but after these last 6 weeks
                    and the capabilities Iâ€™ve shown throughout, it shows that maybe I should work towards being a full
                    stack developer (front-end and back-end).
