                <p>
                    It has definitely been a year for me, for most of us in fact. Some of us have lost loved one, some
                    of
                    us have lost our jobs but we still here and I definitely have to thank God for his protection üôèüèæ
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the last 5 months or so, it has definitely been good to me despite everything. I can finally say
                    that I‚Äôm a Junior Front-End Developer which is pretty amazing before I was completely lost, didn‚Äôt
                    know exactly what I wanted to do even beginning of this year, I didn‚Äôt know what kind of developer I
                    wanted to be. Was it Back-End? Was it Front-End? Was it Full-Stack? Literally, I had no idea but I
                    managed to figure it out in the end.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned before, I‚Äôve said the last 5 months have been so amazing, I‚Äôve been able to do things I
                    would never have dreamt of doing and I‚Äôm so proud of accomplishing them!

                <ol>
                    <li>Launched my website -
                        <p>Proudest moment ever. I coded this whole desktop and mobile website from scratch. It showed
                            me that I was actually capable of creating this website by myself. Although, I‚Äôm not a web
                            designer, it still came together!
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Guest speaker at a tech webinar -
                        <p>
                            Anyone that knows me, knows I do not speak in public settings EVER!! So when I was asked to
                            speak I was absolutely scared and nervous. I remember telling the host that I didn‚Äôt think I
                            could do it, that I was shy, I didn‚Äôt have much experience, what could I possibly say. I WAS
                            NERVOUS lol!<br>
                            I agreed to do it in the end because I really wanted to step out of my comfort zone, I
                            really wanted to put myself out there and I always had my motto, ‚ÄúDo It Afraid‚Äù. I did it,
                            although I was extremely nervous and rambled a lot and rushed it, I really did it!
                        </p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Mentoring -
                        <p>
                            It was through being a guest speaker that someone had approached me for mentoring. Again, I
                            had this thought, why me? What could I possibly mentor them on? Again, ‚ÄúDo It Afraid‚Äù.<br>
                            Every developer that I know and that I follow on different social media platforms actually
                            do not know everything. So even if I do not have years of experience, I can easily share
                            what I already know plus learn some more from questions I may be asked.<br>
                            Now, I‚Äôm mentoring this amazing person who is super eager to learn but also someone I can
                            learn from!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </p>

                <p>
                    I‚Äôm continuing with my motto for next year ‚ÄúDo it Afraid‚Äù because it‚Äôs really pushed me out of my
                    comfort zone!
                </p>

                <p>You guys will be reading this post from my new webiste. I wanted to change up my website because I
                    wanted to improve the way the old website looked, add a little colour. Hope you guys enjoy it as
                    much as I enjoyed building it!</p>

                    <p>Ending this year on a high!</p>
                    <p>Happy New Year üòä</p>
