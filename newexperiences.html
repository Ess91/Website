            <section>
                <p>
                    I've had so much going on that I don’t even know how to write my experiences. So I thought let me
                    just type and let the words flow and I’m sure once I get going I’ll have something solid to share
                    with you guys.
                    My last post was on my experience with Chingu (which again was amazing). So what have I done since
                    then?
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Job Hunting</h4>
                <p>
                    With the job hunting, I took a small break in the job hunting whilst doing the Chingu experience.
                    Although I was building the skills and knowledge, I didn’t have the commercial experience that I
                    needed based on previous job applications and that was the main reason in stopping the job hunting.
                    So after the Chingu experience, I resumed job hunting, expanding my search and including junior full
                    stack engineers just because I felt I was capable of doing such a role. So now knowing which roles I
                    wanted to apply for, I really revamped my CV and LinkedIn profile to really show my projects, as I
                    wanted to show more of my projects as I was lacking in the experiences section. I am part of the
                    Coding Black Females community and so I reached out on Slack for anyone that could potentially help
                    me with my CV and LinkedIn profile and found someone amazing that really took their time with me in
                    explaining different elements I needed for my resume. That advice alone pretty much boosted my
                    confidence but it also allowed me to show that I was capable of the jobs that I was applying for.
                    <br><br>
                    I am taking a different approach to how I am applying for these roles. Before, I mentioned in videos
                    that I have done and blog posts, that a lot of these companies are looking for "junior" roles that
                    require you to have at least three years commercial experiences plus a computer degree, and it
                    already stopped me from even applying and even reading the rest of the job description. Now, I fully
                    look through the job description and I feel if I can do at least three (three being my minimum) of
                    the
                    criteria that they are asking for, I'm applying even if I'm lacking in experience, I'm applying.
                    Along with this new approach and trying to stay organised, I've developed a spreadsheet and pretty
                    much noting what jobs I've applied for, if it is directly on company website or through recruiters,
                    the date of when I applied, follow-up-dates and if I've been successful etc. It allows me to see
                    that I'm applying for jobs but also me accountable in a way.
                </p>

                <h4>Freelancing</h4>
                <p>
                    So I have been looking to freelance, although I wasn't sure as to where to start. I have been following a
                    few people on Twitter who 100% campaign (not sure if campaign is the right word) for freelancing and
                    give helpful tips on freelancing and the way to go about it. 
                    Freelancing for me, I believe would really help with the lack of commercial experience that I have.
                    I believe it will help me with working with clients, working with a set of requirements, working
                    towards a deadline to name a few. <br>
                    So I started pretty much researching pricing, what would the average junior web developer be
                    charging. In terms of pricing, I haven’t figured it out all the way but I do have some sort of idea
                    just based on freelancing jobs that I have done so far.<br>
                    I've now been doing it for a few months, really trying to promote myself and getting these clien
