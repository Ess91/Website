            <section>
                <p>
                    I've had so much going on that I don’t even know how to start. So I thought let me
                    just type and let the words flow and I’m sure once I get going I’ll have something solid to share
                    with you guys.
                    My last post was on my experience with Chingu (which again was amazing). So what have I done since
                    then?
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Job Hunting</h4>
                <p>
                    With the job hunting, I took a small break in the job hunting whilst doing the Chingu experience.
                    Although I was building the skills and knowledge, I felt I did not have enough experience that I
                    needed based on previous job applications and that was the main reason in stopping the job hunting.
                    So after the Chingu experience, I resumed job hunting, expanding my search and including junior full
                    stack engineers just because I felt I was capable of doing such a role. So now knowing which roles I
                    wanted to apply for, I really revamped my CV, LinkedIn and Github profile to really show my
                    projects, as I
                    more projects than relevant experiences. I am part of the
                    Coding Black Females community and so I reached out on Slack for anyone that could potentially help
                    me with my CV and LinkedIn profile and found someone amazing that really took their time with me in
                    explaining different elements I needed for my CV. That advice alone pretty much boosted my
                    confidence but it also allowed me to show that I was capable of the jobs that I was applying for.
                    <br><br>
                    I am now taking a different approach to how I am applying for these roles. Before, I mentioned in
                    videos
                    that I have done and blog posts, that a lot of these companies are looking for "junior" roles that
                    require you to have at least three years commercial experiences plus a computer degree, and it
                    already stopped me from even applying and even reading the rest of the job description. Now, I fully
                    look through the job description and I feel if I can do at least three (three being my minimum) of
                    the
                    criteria that they are asking for, I'm applying even if I'm lacking in experience....I'm applying.
                    Along with this new approach and trying to stay organised, I've developed a spreadsheet and pretty
                    much noting down what jobs I've applied for, if it is directly on the company's website or through
                    recruiters,
                    the date of when I applied, follow-up-dates and if I've been successful etc. It allows me to see
                    that I'm applying for jobs but also holds me accountable in a way.
                </p>

                <h4>Freelancing</h4>
                <p>
                    So I have been looking to freelance, although I wasn't sure as to where to start. I have been
                    following a
                    few people on Twitter who 100% campaign (not sure if campaign is the right word) for freelancing and
                    give helpful tips on freelancing and the way to go about it.
                    Freelancing for me, I believe would really help with the lack of commercial experience that I have.
                    I believe it will help me with working with clients, working with a set of requirements, working
                    towards a deadline to name a few. <br>
                    So I started pretty much researching pricing, what would the average junior web developer be
                    charging and the process from start to finish. In terms of pricing, I haven’t figured it out all the
                    way but I do have some sort of idea
                    just based on freelancing jobs that I have done so far. I have figured out my process from when
                    first enquiry of my services until the end when the client gets their "outcome" so to speak. I am
                    definitely learning as I go along, seeing what works for me and also for the client as well and
                    really adjust in making it as smooth as possible.<br>
                    I've now been doing it for a few months, really trying to promote myself and getting these
                    clients...so stay tuned!
                </p>

                <h4>Social Presence</h4>
                <p>

                    Based on advice, social media is pretty much a powerful tool to really get yourself out there and
                    for even potential recruiters to see how active you are.
                    In terms of Instagram and Facebook, I’ve been somewhat active in promoting what I do and also trying
                    to engage with other people.
                    I recently discovered that LinkedIn is a goldmine for recruiters looking for their perfect
                    candidates. What I was told was that by continuously being active on LinkedIn it allows them to see
                    that you are being constant, attending virtual events etc . It shows them that you are
                    really interested in the job role that you want and you are continuously gaining information and
                    also at the same time sharpening your skills.
                </p>

                <h4>Code First Girls</h4>
                <p>
                    I started “Introduction to Web Development” in conjunction with Natwest on the 20th May and it's
                    every week
                    for at least 2 hours. I did the first session and I actually wanted to withdraw from the course only
                    because I pretty much knew the basics of HTML/CSS but then I decided I wanted to continue until the
                    end and I’m glad I did.
                    I am learning new things and I am working in a team for the group project which is
                    pretty exciting. My team is amazing, all skillsets and the project idea that we came up with is
                    great and with the
                    different job backgrounds and knowledge that we have, it really ties in well with the project and I
                    can’t wait to show you guys the end results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So these are the four main things that I have been putting my focus on, really trying to really
                    commit myself to each one of these points that I have mentioned above. As it is the experience that
                    I am really focusing on, I am really using these four areas to really bridge to make myself stronger
                    in a way.
