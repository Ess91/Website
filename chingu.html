                <p>After finishing up on my solo project, I received feedback.. my first ever feedback on a project I did
                by the way. It felt amazing to receive feedback because it’s good knowing what you did right and what
                can be improved. Even doing the solo project and looking at the requirements needed to complete this
                challenge, I learnt so much in terms of learning something new but also knowing that I can actually
                create a website. This solo project was my further push in wanting to freelance.
                So I've completed the solo project which was a website clone, which can be seen in the portfolio
                page, <a href="conquer-clone.html">Conquer Clone Project</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                My six weeks journey was about to start..<br>
                Monday 1st February, in the evening I had met the two other members of my team briefly. One was from
                Estonia and the other from America, two different time zones but we had to make it work for whatever
                project we decided to do. Once we had introduced ourselves, we set a time schedule to officially talk
                about the project and discuss our skills in a way - first meeting Monday 8th.

                <br>

                The first few days were overwhelming because it’s where exactly do you start? They do have handbooks for
                us to read but even reading it was a little overwhelming only because it was my first team project ever.
                I reached out to the Chingu facilitators and explained my worries and how I was overwhelmed with all
                this information. They did give me some additional resources that really explained what each week should
                entail and made me feel I could reach out to them even though they were dealing with other groups.</p>

                This is the end of the first week with 5 weeks left to go…
                <br><br>

                <p>
                So we had our first meeting which was pretty daunting even though it was a voice call, my first thought
                was, “How am I going to do this?” but proceeded anyway. It was awkward for me because normally I’m a
                very quiet and reserved person and I don’t talk much and so was feeling very nervous. My teammates
                seemed quiet which for me felt strange because like I said I’m the quiet one. To “break the quietness”,
                I spoke up, asked questions about themselves and their skills; the first official meeting done. Over the
                next week, we met again to discuss the ideas we had, one idea was to create a sort of sports app, which
                would include information on the scheduled matches, players etc, this would be more targeted to those
                who were fairly new in following sports events. The other idea was having an app which will include
                several movie/music streaming services and showing their top 5 watches/listens and placing them all
                under one application. We went for the latter because it was something everyone was interested in. We
                discussed what would be needed to make this application happen, the front-end and back-end developments.
                The front-end was making the application look attractive and the back-end was retrieving the user data
                and placing it in the new application. When I first applied for the Chingu, I initially wanted to
                improve my front-end development skills but when we discussed the project because I had experiences with
                API (Application Programming Interface), I ended up doing the back-end of the application.</p>
                <br>
